# Vehicle-Classification-ML-Project

This repository contains materials for a **Vehicle Type Identification** project completed as part of a University of Connecticut Big Data course.

The goal of this project was to train and evaluate a deep learning model capable of classifying a vehicle’s body type from an image. The model predicts one of the following categories: SUV, van, pickup, convertible, 4-door, or 2-door. The project focuses on image classification, dataset preparation, model selection, and performance evaluation.

## Repository Contents

- **Final Code**

## Project Notes

- The project explored multiple convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, including baseline models and pretrained networks.
- Emphasis was placed on dataset cleaning, model comparison, and iterative improvement.
- Final results achieved approximately **80% test accuracy**, with detailed evaluation using confusion matrices and validation metrics.

## Technologies Used

- Programming Language: Python  
- Libraries / Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn  
- Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook / Python environment
